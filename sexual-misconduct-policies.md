## I. Introduction

In recognition of Georgetown University’s commitment to provide a safe and hospitable environment for all members of our community to work and study, the University prohibits sexual misconduct that constitutes sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, and related claims of retaliation. Sexual misconduct subverts the University's mission, diminishes the dignity of both Complainant and Respondent, and threatens permanent damage to the careers, educational experience, and well-being of our students, faculty and staff.
Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited by University policy, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), and the District of Columbia Human Rights Act. Sexual assault, relationship violence and stalking are also forms of sexual misconduct, and are prohibited by law and this policy.

The Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures are a supplement to the Code of Student Conduct and the Standard Hearing Policies and Procedures. They are designed to provide for prompt, thorough, and equitable investigation and resolution of complaints that involve allegations of sexual misconduct filed against University students through the student conduct system. The University will conduct a reliable and impartial investigation of sexual misconduct complaints to determine the relevant facts from which a well-informed decision can be made and an appropriate resolution reached. The Georgetown University student conduct procedures are conducted by officials who receive annual and ongoing training on, among other things, the University’s policies and procedures, how to conduct a fair and equitable adjudication, and the effects of trauma on parties impacted by sexual misconduct.

Both women and men may be victims of sexual misconduct. Sexual misconduct may occur between persons of the same or opposite sex.
The student conduct system is designed to fit within the University’s larger education system and does not function as a court of law. As such, the Office of Student Conduct utilizes language that is designed to be both educationally-focused and procedurally neutral when describing its policies and procedures. Additionally, procedural issues, including the introduction and consideration of information, are handled in a manner consistent with the University’s educational focus. The student conduct system is not a substitute for the criminal and civil courts, but it is an additional option for Complainants to resolve their complaint when the Respondent is a Georgetown University student.
