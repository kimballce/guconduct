## I. Introduction

In recognition of Georgetown University’s commitment to provide a safe and hospitable environment for all members of our community to work and study, the University prohibits sexual misconduct that constitutes sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, and related claims of retaliation. Sexual misconduct subverts the University's mission, diminishes the dignity of both Complainant and Respondent, and threatens permanent damage to the careers, educational experience, and well-being of our students, faculty and staff.
Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited by University policy, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), and the District of Columbia Human Rights Act. Sexual assault, relationship violence and stalking are also forms of sexual misconduct, and are prohibited by law and this policy.

The Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures are a supplement to the Code of Student Conduct and the Standard Hearing Policies and Procedures. They are designed to provide for prompt, thorough, and equitable investigation and resolution of complaints that involve allegations of sexual misconduct filed against University students through the student conduct system. The University will conduct a reliable and impartial investigation of sexual misconduct complaints to determine the relevant facts from which a well-informed decision can be made and an appropriate resolution reached. The Georgetown University student conduct procedures are conducted by officials who receive annual and ongoing training on, among other things, the University’s policies and procedures, how to conduct a fair and equitable adjudication, and the effects of trauma on parties impacted by sexual misconduct.

Both women and men may be victims of sexual misconduct. Sexual misconduct may occur between persons of the same or opposite sex.
The student conduct system is designed to fit within the University’s larger education system and does not function as a court of law. As such, the Office of Student Conduct utilizes language that is designed to be both educationally-focused and procedurally neutral when describing its policies and procedures. Additionally, procedural issues, including the introduction and consideration of information, are handled in a manner consistent with the University’s educational focus. The student conduct system is not a substitute for the criminal and civil courts, but it is an additional option for Complainants to resolve their complaint when the Respondent is a Georgetown University student.

## II. Definitions
The following selected terms are defined in an effort to facilitate a better understanding of the Office of Student Conduct’s Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures:  
1. “Complainant” refers to an individual(s) who has filed a formal complaint against a Georgetown University student through the student conduct system. In cases when the University serves as the “Complainant,” this term may be used to describe both the University and/or the alleged Victim(s).  
2. “Director for Student Conduct” refers to the individual responsible for properly implementing fair conduct procedures and overseeing the administration of the student conduct system. The Director may designate any other appropriate individual to perform these duties.  
3. “Formal Complaint” refers to the written statement from an individual indicating their intent to pursue a complaint through the Georgetown University student conduct system.  
4. “Investigator” refers to an individual(s) appointed by the University to conduct a prompt, thorough, and equitable investigation into a complaint involving allegations of sexual misconduct. The Investigator will have specific training and expertise in, among other things, the University’s policies and procedures, how to conduct a fair and equitable investigation, and the effects of trauma on parties impacted by sexual misconduct.  
5. “Respondent” refers to a Georgetown student who has been alleged of violating the Code of Student Conduct while they were a Georgetown student through the Georgetown University student conduct system.  
6. “Judicial Coordinator” refers to the individual responsible for attending any Hearing and/or Appeals meeting to ensure that these procedures are conducted in an efficient and orderly fashion. The Judicial Coordinator may interject in cases of clear procedural error, as well as answer questions of the Panels regarding procedures. The Judicial Coordinator will not vote on any decision by a Sexual Misconduct Hearing and/or Appeals Committee. The Director may designate any appropriate individual to perform these duties.  
7. “Appeals Committee” refers to the standing Appeals Committee composed of a senior administrator from Student Affairs, a faculty/staff representative, and a student representative. The Appeals Committee is responsible for reviewing all appeals through the student conduct system. The Appeals Committee will have specific training on, among other things, the University’s policies and procedures, how to conduct a fair and equitable adjudication, and the effects of trauma on parties impacted by sexual misconduct.  
8. “Sexual Misconduct Hearing Panel” refers to a Hearing Panel comprised of two (2) faculty/staff members and one (1) student that hears cases involving allegations of sexual misconduct. At the written request of both the Complainant and Respondent, the Office of Student Conduct will substitute a faculty/staff member in place of the one (1) student member of the panel for Sexual Misconduct cases. If this request is not submitted, in writing, by both the Complainant and Respondent, the Hearing Panel will remain two (2) faculty/staff members and one (1) student. The Hearing Panel will have specific training on, among other things, the University’s policies and procedures, how to conduct a fair and equitable adjudication, and the effects of trauma on parties impacted by sexual misconduct.  
9. “Sexual Misconduct Policy” refers to the Office of Student Conduct’s policies on sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence, and stalking (see also: Sexual Misconduct Policy, p. 7).  
10. “Sexual Misconduct Procedures” refers to the Office of Student Conduct’s procedures to address complaints involving allegations of sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence, and stalking (see also: Sexual Misconduct Procedures, p. 11).  
11. “Student” refers to an individual admitted into an undergraduate, graduate, or School of Continuing Studies course or program at Georgetown University.  

## III. Jurisdiction
1. These policies and procedures apply for an individual or the University (“Complainant”) filing a complaint involving allegations of sexual misconduct against a current Georgetown University student (“Respondent”). These policies and procedures are applicable to behaviors that occur on-campus, as well as behaviors that occur off-campus or while studying abroad, when, in the judgement of the Office of Student Conduct, the alleged conduct has a negative impact on the University community, the pursuit of its mission, or the broader community in which we live.  
    1. If a complaint involves allegations of both sexual misconduct and non-sexual misconduct (e.g. Sexual Misconduct and Physical Assault), these policies and procedures may be utilized to resolve all charges associated with the incident.
    2. For cases when the University is serving at the Complainant, or when there are multiple Complainant(s) and/or Respondent(s) involved, the Director for Student Conduct may make reasonable alterations to these procedures, including consolidating multiple cases into a single case where appropriate, in the spirit of providing a prompt, thorough, and equitable process for all parties involved in the student conduct process (see also: Consolidated Cases, p. 7; Procedural Alterations, p. 27).  
2. These policies and procedures are not applicable for complaints against faculty/staff, School of Medicine students, or Law Center students. For more information regarding those grievance procedures, please visit: http://sexualassault.georgetown.edu/.  


## IV. Multiple Complainant(s)/Respondent(s)
For cases involving **multiple Complainant(s) and/or Respondent(s)**, the Director for Student Conduct may make reasonable alterations to these procedures in the spirit of providing a prompt, thorough, and equitable process for all parties involved in the student conduct process (see also: Procedural Alterations, p. 27).  

## V. Consolidated Cases
The Office of Student Conduct may **consolidate multiple cases and/or incidents** to resolve as a single case under the following circumstances:  
1. The Respondent is alleged to have been involved in multiple incidents of sexual misconduct with the same Complainant;
2. The Respondent is alleged to have been involved in the same incident(s) or closely interrelated incident(s) of sexual misconduct with multiple Complainants;
3. More than one Respondent is alleged to have been involved in the same incident(s) or closely interrelated incident(s) of sexual misconduct with the same Complainant.

## VI. Sexual Misconduct Policy
Georgetown University has adopted a Policy Statement on Sexual Misconduct in recognition of our commitment to provide a safe and hospitable environment for all members of our community to work and study. The Office of Student Conduct has adopted the following policies, based on the University’s Policy Statement on Sexual Misconduct:  
1. __Sexual Misconduct__ is unwanted conduct of a sexual nature that constitutes sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence (including domestic violence and dating violence), or stalking, and includes related acts of retaliation.
2. __Sexual Harassment__ is defined as any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including sexual advances, request for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual or gender-based nature when:
    1. Submission to such conduct is made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or academic relationship; or
    2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for making an employment or academic decision affecting an individual; or
    3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual's work or academic performance, denying or limiting an individual’s ability to participate in or benefit from the University’s education programs, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for work or academic pursuit.
    An Administrator’s or Hearing Board’s use of interpretative guidance in determining sexual harassment in a case includes, but is not limited to:
        1. A hostile or offensive environment exists when conduct is severe or pervasive. Factors to be considered in determining whether conduct is severe or pervasive include the nature, scope, frequency, and duration of the conduct and the
8
number of persons involved. Simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not severe or pervasive do not create a hostile or offensive environment.
        2. If an issue of sexual harassment is raised in strictly academic areas, such as coursework, the matter will be handled in consultation and coordination between IDEAA and the Executive Vice President or Dean of the faculty member’s school because such matters may also implicate issues of academic freedom.
        3. To constitute sexual harassment, the conduct in question must be objectively intimidating, hostile or offensive, and must interfere with a person’s ability to participate in employment or educational programs or activities of the University. The victim’s perception of the offensiveness of the alleged conduct, standing alone, is not sufficient by itself to constitute sexual harassment.
        4. Sexual harassment is especially serious when it occurs between teachers and students or supervisors and subordinates. In such situations, sexual harassment unfairly exploits the power inherent in a faculty member's or supervisor's position. Although sexual harassment often occurs when one person takes advantage of a position of authority over another, the University recognizes that sexual harassment may also occur between people of equivalent status. This includes peer sexual harassment. Regardless of the form it may take, the University will not tolerate unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that creates an unacceptable working or educational environment.
3. __Sexual Assault__ is a forcible or non-forcible sexual act or sexual contact that occurs without the consent or permission of the other person. Sexual assault is divided into five categories, described below. Sanctions may vary depending on the category of offense.
    1. Engaging in a sexual act with the use of force; use of threats or fear; after rendering the person unconscious; or by administering a drug, intoxicant, or other substance that substantially impairs the ability of the other person to appraise or control his or her conduct.
    2. Engaging in a sexual act where the person knows or reasonably should know that the other person is incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct; incapable of declining participation in the sexual conduct; incapable of communicating unwillingness to engage in the sexual conduct; or incapable of giving consent (such as when the person is incapacitated due to alcohol use).
    3. Engaging in sexual contact with another person with the use of force; use of threats or fear; after rendering the person unconscious; or by administering a drug, intoxicant, or other substance that substantially impairs the ability of the other person to appraise or control his or her conduct.
9
    4. Engaging in sexual contact where the person knows or reasonably should know that the other person is incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct; incapable of declining participation in the sexual conduct; incapable of communicating unwillingness to engage in the sexual conduct; or incapable of giving consent (such as when the person is incapacitated due to alcohol use).
    5. Engaging in a sexual act or sexual contact with another person with knowledge or reason to know that the sexual act or sexual contact was unwanted and committed without the person’s permission or consent.  
**For purposes of this definition, the following terms are defined:**  
    1. *Sexual act* is penetration, however slight, of the anus or vulva of another by a penis; contact between the mouth and the penis, vulva, or anus; or the penetration, however slight, of the anus or vulva by a hand or finger or by any object. The emission of semen is not required to be considered a sexual act.
    2. *Sexual contact* means the touching with any clothed or unclothed body part or any object, either directly or through the clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person.
    3. *Consent* is words or overt actions indicating a freely given agreement to the sexual act or sexual contact in question.  
    
*An Administrator’s or Hearing Panel’s use of interpretative guidance in determining consent in a case includes, but is not limited to:*  
        1. The willingness to participate must be clearly indicated prior to any sexual act or sexual contact.
        2. If at any time during the sexual act or sexual contact any confusion or ambiguity should arise on the issue of consent, it is incumbent upon the individual to stop the activity and clarify, verbally, the other’s willingness to continue.
        3. A verbal “no,” even if it may sound indecisive or insincere, constitutes lack of consent.
        4. The absence of an overt action or an explicit verbal response to a verbal request for consent constitutes lack of consent.
        5. It is expected that, once consent has been established, a person who changes his/her mind during the sexual act or sexual contact will communicate through words or overt actions his/her decision to no longer proceed.
        6. Past consent to sexual act or sexual contact does not imply future ongoing consent, and the fact that two persons are in an on-going relationship shall
10
not preclude the possibility that sexual misconduct might occur within that relationship.
        7. A person’s use of alcohol and/or other drugs shall not diminish such person’s responsibility to obtain consent.
        8. Lack of verbal or physical resistance, or submission by the unwilling participant, when such submission results from the use of force, threats, or coercion by the respondent shall not constitute consent.
        9. A person is considered incapable of giving consent if he/she is asleep, unconscious, and/or losing and regaining consciousness, or clearly mentally or physically incapacitated, for example, by alcohol and/or other drugs (signs of incapacitation include, but are not limited to, difficulty walking, inability to speak in a coherent manner, vomiting or the presence of vomit, etc.)
    4. *Force* means the use or threatened use of a weapon; the use of such physical strength or violence as is sufficient to overcome, restrain, or injure a person; or the use of a threat of harm sufficient to coerce or compel submission by another person.
    5. *Forcible* is defined as any sexual act or sexual contact directed against another person, with force and/or against that person’s will; or without force or against the person’s will where the victim is incapable of giving consent.
4. Relationship Violence means a violent or threatening familial or intimate partner relationship that causes one to fear for his/her safety or causes physical or psychological injury, pain, or illness. Relationship violence includes, but may not be limited to:
    1. *Dating violence*: an offense against an intimate partner (romantic, dating, or sexual relationship) that results in physical injury, including physical pain or illness or that caused or was intended to cause reasonable fear of imminent serious physical injury or death.
    2. *Domestic violence*: an intrafamily offense that results in physical injury, including physical pain or illness, or that caused or was intended to cause reasonable fear of imminent serious physical injury or death.
An Administrator’s or Hearing Panel’s use of interpretative guidance in determining relationship violence in a case includes, but is not limited to:
        1. Intimate Partner refers to individuals who share a current or former romantic, dating, or sexual involvement. Consideration should be given to the duration, nature, and frequency of interaction between the individuals.
        2. Intrafamily refers to individuals who share a biological or legally established ancestral connection (e.g. sibling, parent, or spouse).
        3. Physical or psychological injury, pain or illness should be given consideration for both domestic and dating violence cases.
        4. A reasonable fear for one’s safety can result from the use of physical force and/or abusive behavior intended, or reasonably anticipated to intimidate, manipulate, humiliate, isolate, or coerce another into doing something against his/her will or self-interest. Such behavior includes, but is not limited to physical, verbal, sexual, emotional, technological, or financial forms of abuse.
4. _Stalking__ means a course of conduct directed at a specific individual that places that individual in reasonable fear for his or her safety or the safety of another person; to feel seriously alarmed, disturbed, or frightened; or suffer emotional distress. Such behaviors or activities may include, but are not limited to, the following:
    1. Unwelcomed communication of any type, including but not limited to face-to-face, telephone calls, voice messages, electronic, written letters or notes, unwanted gifts, etc.;
    2. Use of threatening words and/or conduct;
    3. Pursuing, following, observing, and/or surveillance.
