<h2 id="introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
	<p>In recognition of Georgetown University’s commitment to provide a safe and hospitable environment for all members of our community to work and study, the University prohibits sexual misconduct that constitutes sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence, stalking, and related claims of retaliation. Sexual misconduct subverts the University's mission, diminishes the dignity of both Complainant and Respondent, and threatens permanent damage to the careers, educational experience, and well-being of our students, faculty and staff.
	Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination and is prohibited by University policy, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”), Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (“Title IX”), and the District of Columbia Human Rights Act. Sexual assault, relationship violence and stalking are also forms of sexual misconduct, and are prohibited by law and this policy.</p>

	<p>The Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures are a supplement to the Code of Student Conduct and the Standard Hearing Policies and Procedures. They are designed to provide for prompt, thorough, and equitable investigation and resolution of complaints that involve allegations of sexual misconduct filed against University students through the student conduct system. The University will conduct a reliable and impartial investigation of sexual misconduct complaints to determine the relevant facts from which a well-informed decision can be made and an appropriate resolution reached. The Georgetown University student conduct procedures are conducted by officials who receive annual and ongoing training on, among other things, the University’s policies and procedures, how to conduct a fair and equitable adjudication, and the effects of trauma on parties impacted by sexual misconduct.</p>

	<p>Both women and men may be victims of sexual misconduct. Sexual misconduct may occur between persons of the same or opposite sex.
	The student conduct system is designed to fit within the University’s larger education system and does not function as a court of law. As such, the Office of Student Conduct utilizes language that is designed to be both educationally-focused and procedurally neutral when describing its policies and procedures. Additionally, procedural issues, including the introduction and consideration of information, are handled in a manner consistent with the University’s educational focus. The student conduct system is not a substitute for the criminal and civil courts, but it is an additional option for Complainants to resolve their complaint when the Respondent is a Georgetown University student.</p>

<h2 id="definitions">II. Definitions</h2>

	<p>The following selected terms are defined in an effort to facilitate a better understanding of the Office of Student Conduct’s Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures:  </p>

	<ol type="A">
	<li>“Complainant” refers to an individual(s) who has filed a formal complaint against a Georgetown University student through the student conduct system. In cases when the University serves as the “Complainant,” this term may be used to describe both the University and/or the alleged Victim(s).</li>

	<li>“Director for Student Conduct” refers to the individual responsible for properly implementing fair conduct procedures and overseeing the administration of the student conduct system. The Director may designate any other appropriate individual to perform these duties.</li>

	<li>“Formal Complaint” refers to the written statement from an individual indicating their intent to pursue a complaint through the Georgetown University student conduct system.</li>

	<li>“Investigator” refers to an individual(s) appointed by the University to conduct a prompt, thorough, and equitable investigation into a complaint involving allegations of sexual misconduct. The Investigator will have specific training and expertise in, among other things, the University’s policies and procedures, how to conduct a fair and equitable investigation, and the effects of trauma on parties impacted by sexual misconduct.</li>

	<li>“Respondent” refers to a Georgetown student who has been alleged of violating the Code of Student Conduct while they were a Georgetown student through the Georgetown University student conduct system.</li>

	<li>“Judicial Coordinator” refers to the individual responsible for attending any Hearing and/or Appeals meeting to ensure that these procedures are conducted in an efficient and orderly fashion. The Judicial Coordinator may interject in cases of clear procedural error, as well as answer questions of the Panels regarding procedures. The Judicial Coordinator will not vote on any decision by a Sexual Misconduct Hearing and/or Appeals Committee. The Director may designate any appropriate individual to perform these duties.</li>

	<li>“Appeals Committee” refers to the standing Appeals Committee composed of a senior administrator from Student Affairs, a faculty/staff representative, and a student representative. The Appeals Committee is responsible for reviewing all appeals through the student conduct system.

	</ol>
</div>

<div id="jurisdiction">
<h2 id="jurisdiction">III. Jurisdiction</h2>

	<ol type="A">
	<li>These policies and procedures apply for an individual or the University (“Complainant”) filing a complaint involving allegations of sexual misconduct against a current Georgetown University student (“Respondent”). These policies and procedures are applicable to behaviors that occur on-campus, as well as behaviors that occur off-campus or while studying abroad, when, in the judgement of the Office of Student Conduct, the alleged conduct has a negative impact on the University community, the pursuit of its mission, or the broader community in which we live. <br />

		<ol>
		<li>If a complaint involves allegations of both sexual misconduct and non-sexual misconduct (e.g. Sexual Misconduct and Physical Assault), these policies and procedures may be utilized to resolve all charges associated with the incident.</li>

		<li>For cases when the University is serving at the Complainant, or when there are multiple Complainant(s) and/or Respondent(s) involved, the Director for Student Conduct may make reasonable alterations to these procedures, including consolidating multiple cases into a single case where appropriate, in the spirit of providing a prompt, thorough, and equitable process for all parties involved in the student conduct process (see also: Consolidated Cases, p. 7; Procedural Alterations, p. 27).</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>These policies and procedures are not applicable for complaints against faculty/staff, School of Medicine students, or Law Center students. For more information regarding those grievance procedures, please visit: <A href="http://sexualassault.georgetown.edu/">http://sexualassault.georgetown.edu</a>.</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<div id="multiplecomplainantsrespondents">
<h2 id="multiplecomplainantsrespondents">IV. Multiple Complainant(s)/Respondent(s)</h2>
	<p>For cases involving <strong>multiple Complainant(s) and/or Respondent(s)</strong>, the Director for Student Conduct may make reasonable alterations to these procedures in the spirit of providing a prompt, thorough, and equitable process for all parties involved in the student conduct process (see also: Procedural Alterations, p. 27).  </p>
</div>

<div id="consolidatedcases">
<h2 id="consolidatedcases">V. Consolidated Cases</h2>
	<p>The Office of Student Conduct may <strong>consolidate multiple cases and/or incidents</strong> to resolve as a single case under the following circumstances:</p>

	<ol type="1">
	<li>The Respondent is alleged to have been involved in multiple incidents of sexual misconduct with the same Complainant;</li>

	<li>The Respondent is alleged to have been involved in the same incident(s) or closely interrelated incident(s) of sexual misconduct with multiple Complainants;</li>

	<li>More than one Respondent is alleged to have been involved in the same incident(s) or closely interrelated incident(s) of sexual misconduct with the same Complainant.</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<div id="sexualmisconductpolicy">
<h2 id="sexualmisconductpolicy">VI. Sexual Misconduct Policy</h2>

	<p>Georgetown University has adopted a Policy Statement on Sexual Misconduct in recognition of our commitment to provide a safe and hospitable environment for all members of our community to work and study. The Office of Student Conduct has adopted the following policies, based on the University’s Policy Statement on Sexual Misconduct:  </p>

	<ol type="A">
	<li><u>Sexual Misconduct</u> is unwanted conduct of a sexual nature that constitutes sexual harassment, sexual assault, relationship violence (including domestic violence and dating violence), or stalking, and includes related acts of retaliation.</li>

	<li><u>Sexual Harassment</u> is defined as any unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, including sexual advances, request for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual or gender-based nature when:

		<ol type="1">
		<li>Submission to such conduct is made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment or academic relationship; or</li>

		<li>Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for making an employment or academic decision affecting an individual; or</li>

		<li>Such conduct has the purpose or effect of interfering with an individual's work or academic performance, denying or limiting an individual’s ability to participate in or benefit from the University’s education programs, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for work or academic pursuit.

		<p><i>An Administrator’s or Hearing Board’s use of interpretative guidance in determining sexual harassment in a case includes, but is not limited to:</i></p>

			<ol type="a">
			<li>A hostile or offensive environment exists when conduct is severe or pervasive. Factors to be considered in determining whether conduct is severe or pervasive include the nature, scope, frequency, and duration of the conduct and the number of persons involved. Simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not severe or pervasive do not create a hostile or offensive environment.</li>

			<li>If an issue of sexual harassment is raised in strictly academic areas, such as coursework, the matter will be handled in consultation and coordination between IDEAA and the Executive Vice President or Dean of the faculty member’s school because such matters may also implicate issues of academic freedom.</li>

			<li>To constitute sexual harassment, the conduct in question must be objectively intimidating, hostile or offensive, and must interfere with a person’s ability to participate in employment or educational programs or activities of the University. The victim’s perception of the offensiveness of the alleged conduct, standing alone, is not sufficient by itself to constitute sexual harassment.</li>

			<li>Sexual harassment is especially serious when it occurs between teachers and students or supervisors and subordinates. In such situations, sexual harassment unfairly exploits the power inherent in a faculty member's or supervisor's position. Although sexual harassment often occurs when one person takes advantage of a position of authority over another, the University recognizes that sexual harassment may also occur between people of equivalent status. This includes peer sexual harassment. Regardless of the form it may take, the University will not tolerate unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that creates an unacceptable working or educational environment.</li></ol>
			</li>
			</ol>
		</li>

	<li><u>Sexual Assault</u> is a forcible or non-forcible sexual act or sexual contact that occurs without the consent or permission of the other person. Sexual assault is divided into five categories, described below. Sanctions may vary depending on the category of offense.

		<ol>
		<li>Engaging in a sexual act with the use of force; use of threats or fear; after rendering the person unconscious; or by administering a drug, intoxicant, or other substance that substantially impairs the ability of the other person to appraise or control his or her conduct.</li>

		<li>Engaging in a sexual act where the person knows or reasonably should know that the other person is incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct; incapable of declining participation in the sexual conduct; incapable of communicating unwillingness to engage in the sexual conduct; or incapable of giving consent (such as when the person is incapacitated due to alcohol use).</li>

		<li>Engaging in sexual contact with another person with the use of force; use of threats or fear; after rendering the person unconscious; or by administering a drug, intoxicant, or other substance that substantially impairs the ability of the other person to appraise or control his or her conduct.
		9</li>

		<li>Engaging in sexual contact where the person knows or reasonably should know that the other person is incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct; incapable of declining participation in the sexual conduct; incapable of communicating unwillingness to engage in the sexual conduct; or incapable of giving consent (such as when the person is incapacitated due to alcohol use).</li>

		<li>Engaging in a sexual act or sexual contact with another person with knowledge or reason to know that the sexual act or sexual contact was unwanted and committed without the person’s permission or consent.  </li></ol>
		</li>

	<p><strong>For purposes of this definition, the following terms are defined:</strong> <br />
		<ol>
		<li><em>Sexual act</em> is penetration, however slight, of the anus or vulva of another by a penis; contact between the mouth and the penis, vulva, or anus; or the penetration, however slight, of the anus or vulva by a hand or finger or by any object. The emission of semen is not required to be considered a sexual act.</li>
		
		<li><em>Sexual contact</em> means the touching with any clothed or unclothed body part or any object, either directly or through the clothing, of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person.</li>
		
		<li><em>Consent</em> is words or overt actions indicating a freely given agreement to the sexual act or sexual contact in question.</li>

		<p><em>An Administrator’s or Hearing Panel’s use of interpretative guidance in determining consent in a case includes, but is not limited to:</em> <br />
			<ol type="a">
			<li>The willingness to participate must be clearly indicated prior to any sexual act or sexual contact.</li>
			
			<li>If at any time during the sexual act or sexual contact any confusion or ambiguity should arise on the issue of consent, it is incumbent upon the individual to stop the activity and clarify, verbally, the other’s willingness to continue.</li>
			
			<li>A verbal “no,” even if it may sound indecisive or insincere, constitutes lack of consent.</li>
			
			<li>The absence of an overt action or an explicit verbal response to a verbal request for consent constitutes lack of consent.</li>
			
			<li>It is expected that, once consent has been established, a person who changes his/her mind during the sexual act or sexual contact will communicate through words or overt actions his/her decision to no longer proceed.</li>
			
			<li>Past consent to sexual act or sexual contact does not imply future ongoing consent, and the fact that two persons are in an on-going relationship shall not preclude the possibility that sexual misconduct might occur within that relationship.</li>
			
			<li>A person’s use of alcohol and/or other drugs shall not diminish such person’s responsibility to obtain consent.</li>
			
			<li>Lack of verbal or physical resistance, or submission by the unwilling participant, when such submission results from the use of force, threats, or coercion by the respondent shall not constitute consent.</li>
			
			<li>A person is considered incapable of giving consent if he/she is asleep, unconscious, and/or losing and regaining consciousness, or clearly mentally or physically incapacitated, for example, by alcohol and/or other drugs (signs of incapacitation include, but are not limited to, difficulty walking, inability to speak in a coherent manner, vomiting or the presence of vomit, etc.)</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<li><em>Force</em> means the use or threatened use of a weapon; the use of such physical strength or violence as is sufficient to overcome, restrain, or injure a person; or the use of a threat of harm sufficient to coerce or compel submission by another person.</li>
		<li><em>Forcible</em> is defined as any sexual act or sexual contact directed against another person, with force and/or against that person’s will; or without force or against the person’s will where the victim is incapable of giving consent.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	
	<li><u>Relationship Violence</u> means a violent or threatening familial or intimate partner relationship that causes one to fear for his/her safety or causes physical or psychological injury, pain, or illness. Relationship violence includes, but may not be limited to:

		<ol>
		<li><em>Dating violence</em>: an offense against an intimate partner (romantic, dating, or sexual relationship) that results in physical injury, including physical pain or illness or that caused or was intended to cause reasonable fear of imminent serious physical injury or death.</li>

		<li><em>Domestic violence</em>: an intrafamily offense that results in physical injury, including physical pain or illness, or that caused or was intended to cause reasonable fear of imminent serious physical injury or death.

		<p><em>An Administrator’s or Hearing Panel’s use of interpretative guidance in determining relationship violence in a case includes, but is not limited to:</em>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>Intimate Partner refers to individuals who share a current or former romantic, dating, or sexual involvement. Consideration should be given to the duration, nature, and frequency of interaction between the individuals.</li>

			<li>Intrafamily refers to individuals who share a biological or legally established ancestral connection (e.g. sibling, parent, or spouse).</li>

			<li>Physical or psychological injury, pain or illness should be given consideration for both domestic and dating violence cases.</li>

			<li>A reasonable fear for one’s safety can result from the use of physical force and/or abusive behavior intended, or reasonably anticipated to intimidate, manipulate, humiliate, isolate, or coerce another into doing something against his/her will or self-interest. Such behavior includes, but is not limited to physical, verbal, sexual, emotional, technological, or financial forms of abuse.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li><u>Stalking</u> means a course of conduct directed at a specific individual that places that individual in reasonable fear for his or her safety or the safety of another person; to feel seriously alarmed, disturbed, or frightened; or suffer emotional distress. Such behaviors or activities may include, but are not limited to, the following:

		<ol type="1">
		<li>Unwelcomed communication of any type, including but not limited to face-to-face, telephone calls, voice messages, electronic, written letters or notes, unwanted gifts, etc.;</li>

		<li>Use of threatening words and/or conduct;</li>

		<li>Pursuing, following, observing, and/or surveillance.</li></ol>
	</li>
	</ol>
</div>

<div id="sexualmisconductprocedures">
<h2 id="sexualmisconductprocedures">VII. Sexual Misconduct Procedures</h2>

	<ol type="A">
	<li>Filing a Formal Complaint</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>In order to initiate a formal complaint, an individual (Complainant) must submit a written statement (“Statement of Complaint”) detailing the allegations of sexual misconduct to the Office of Student Conduct (see also: Reporting Contact Information, p. 28). While the Statement of Complaint is not meant to be an exhaustive account of the incident(s), the statement must state the name or clear identifier of the Respondent and describe with reasonable specificity any of the alleged incident(s) that they want to be addressed by the Office of Student Conduct, including the date and place of the incident(s). The Office of Student Conduct reviews all Statements of Complaint to determine what policy charges, if any, should be applied in each case.</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>The Statement of Complaint may not exceed five (5) pages (see also: Written Statement Guidelines, p. 27).</li>
			<li>While prompt reporting may aid an investigation, there is no time limit imposed as to when a formal complaint may be initiated against a current student, provided they were a Georgetown University student at the time of the alleged incident.</li>
			<li>If a Complainant wishes to remain anonymous and/or does not wish to initiate a formal complaint, the University will strive to accommodate the Complainant’s wishes. However, due to the University’s commitment to provide a reasonably safe and non-discriminatory environment for all students, the Director for Student Conduct may investigate any allegations brought to their attention. For more information, please see: Requests for Anonymity and/or Non-Pursuit of a Complaint, p. 25.</li>
			<li>If an individual is unsure about whether they want to file a formal complaint, the individual is encouraged to contact a confidential counselor. Confidential counselors can help students understand what reporting options are available and assist with the process if they choose to file a formal complaint. Going to a confidential counselor does not foreclose the opportunity to make a report to the University or file a formal complaint at a later time. For more information, please see: Confidential Resources, p. 28.</li>
			</ol>
		<li>A Complainant may also choose to file a criminal report with the Georgetown University Police Department (“GUPD”) and/or Metropolitan Police Department (“MPD”).</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>a. The University student conduct system is a separate system from the criminal justice system. Typically, the University will not wait for the conclusion of a criminal investigation or criminal proceeding to begin its own sexual misconduct investigation. At the request of law enforcement authorities, however, the University may need to delay temporarily the fact-finding portion of a sexual misconduct investigation while the police gather evidence. In those circumstances, the University may still implement Protective Measures and/or additional remedies (see also: Protective Measures and Remedies, p. 23) to protect and support all parties and the University community. The University may also continue to update the parties on the status of the investigation and inform the parties when the school resumes its sexual misconduct investigation.</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>
	<li>Responding to a Formal Complaint</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>The Office of Student Conduct will issue a “No Contact Order” between the Complainant and Respondent.</li>
		<li>The Respondent will be notified that a formal complaint has been submitted to the Office of Student Conduct and a mandatory initial intake meeting will be scheduled with the Office of Student Conduct to review the sexual misconduct adjudication process.</li>
		<li>The Respondent will be provided access to the Statement of Complaint. They will be granted seven (7) calendar days from receipt of the Statement of Complaint to submit his/her written response (“Statement of Response”) to the complaint. Submission of the Statement of Response is not mandatory.</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>The Statement of Response may not exceed five (5) pages (see also: Written Statement Guidelines, p. 27).</li>
			<li>If the Respondent acknowledges responsibility for the alleged behaviors identified in the formal complaint in his/her Statement of Response, the Office of Student Conduct may resolve the incident via Administrative Action. For more information regarding Administrative Action, please refer to the Code of Student Conduct.</li>
			<li>If the Respondent fails to submit a Statement of Response and/or denies responsibility for the alleged behaviors identified in the Statement of Complaint, the Office of Student Conduct will determine the most appropriate method of resolution, which may include forwarding the Statement of Complaint and the Statement of Response to the Title IX Coordinator to appoint an Investigator (“Investigator”) to conduct a prompt, thorough, and equitable investigation into the complaint.</li>
			<li>The Complainant will be provided access to the Respondent's Statement of Response, when applicable, prior to the Complainant's meeting with the Investigator.</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>

	<li>Alternative Methods of Resolution</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>In cases that do not involve sexual assault, both parties and/or the Director for Student Conduct may suggest attempting to resolve the complaint via an alternative method of resolution, such as mediation, at any time during the process.</li>
		<li>The Complainant and Respondent must agree, voluntarily, to the alternative method of resolution. The University will never compel a Complainant and/or Respondent to engage in any type of alternative resolution and/or to directly confront the other party. Participation in an alternative resolution is voluntary and either party can request to resume the formal adjudication process.</li>
		<li>If the parties elect to participate in mediation as part of the alternative resolution process, facilitators will guide a dialogue between the parties either with both parties present, or with both parties separately with the goal of identifying how the harm(s) alleged by the Complainant can be repaired. Together or separately, the parties and the facilitators will create a written agreement that may include items such as apology letters, agreement to a no contact order, restriction of access, and/or education related to the offense. The content of the agreement is created on a casebycase basis, and students are supported in creating their own agreements. The Office of Student Conduct will monitor the parties’ adherence to the signed agreement and close the matter when compliance is deemed complete.</li>
		<li>Alternative methods of conflict resolution may never be used for complaints that involve sexual assault.</li>
		</ol>

	<li>Investigation</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>The Office of Student Conduct will provide the finalized Statement of Complaint and the Statement of Response, when applicable, to the Investigator, Complainant, and Respondent.</li>
		<li>The Investigator will contact the Complainant and Respondent to conduct separate interviews with each party.</li>
			<ol type="a">
				<li>Parties are expected to have their initial interview within seven (7) calendar days of their initial contact by the Investigator.</li>
				<li>During the interviews, the Investigator will ask the parties to identify possible factual witnesses related to the complaint.</li>
			</ol>
		<li>The Investigator may request any additional documentation and/or information that he/she/they deem relevant to the investigation.</li>
		<li>In order to ensure a prompt, thorough, and equitable investigation, parties are expected to adhere to the Investigator’s requested deadlines for any follow up interviews and/or submission of materials.</li>
		<li>The Investigator has the discretion to determine what information he/she/they deem relevant to be included in the Investigative Report.</li>
		</ol>

	<li>Investigative Report</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>Upon completing the investigation, the Investigator will compile the Investigative Report (“Report”). Within the Report, the Investigator will describe the relevant information learned during the investigation and summarize all interviews conducted by the Investigator. The Investigator may not offer any recommendations as to whether a violation of the Code of Student Conduct occurred.</li>
		<li>The Report will be provided to the Office of Student Conduct, who will ensure that it follows the process’ established policies and procedures. The Complainant and Respondent will receive access to the Report from the Office of Student Conduct and may each submit a written response to the Report.</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>The written response may not exceed five (5) pages and must be submitted within seven (7) calendar days after receiving access to the Report (see also: Written Statement Guidelines, p. 27).</li>
			<li>Complainants and Respondents are not permitted to share the Report with any individual(s) other than their advisor and/or parent/guardian(s), provided the parent/guardian(s) is not serving as a witness (see also: Advisor/Support Person, p. 24).</li>
			</ol>
		<li>The Complainant and Respondent may also submit an additional written statement regarding the impact (“Impact Statement”) of the complaint and/or requested remedies by two (2) calendar days before the scheduled Hearing.</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>The Impact Statement may not exceed five (5) pages and may not be included in the official Case File. The Hearing Panel may only consider the Impact Statement during sanctioning if a Respondent is found “Responsible” (see also: Sanctioning, p. 17; Written Statement Guidelines, p. 27).</li>
			</ol>
		<li>Once all deadlines have passed to submit materials, the Office of Student Conduct may review all documents to ensure that they follow the process’ established policies and procedures. The Office of Student Conduct will compile the Report, written responses, and any other materials into the official Case File (“Case File”).</li>
		<li>The inclusion of any materials into the Case File is at the discretion of the Office of Student Conduct. The Office of Student Conduct may remove and/or redact any materials that they deem necessary to ensure a fair and equitable process, such as, but not limited to: character assessments, prejudicial testimony, irrelevant evidence, and/or duplicative information.</li>
		<li>In rare circumstances, where there is no evidence in the Report to support the allegations in the Complaint, the Office of Student Conduct may determine not to move the case forward to a Hearing.</li>
		</ol>

	<li>Hearing</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>A Sexual Misconduct Hearing Panel (“Hearing Panel”) will be assembled to review the Case File, conduct a Hearing, and determine if the Respondent violated a policy of the Code of Student Conduct (see also: Hearing Panels, p. 21). In cases that involve allegations of sexual misconduct, the Hearing Panel will determine if a violation occurred based on the applicable standard of proof and the information submitted to the Hearing Panel.</li>
			<ol tyle="a">
			<li>For all allegations of behaviors included under the policy definition of Sexual Misconduct, the Hearing Panel will use a standard of “More Likely than Not” to determine if a violation occurred.</li>
			<li>For allegations of on-campus behaviors not included under the policy definition of Sexual Misconduct, the Hearing Panel will use a standard of “Clear and Convincing” to determine if a violation occurred.</li>
			<li>For allegations of off-campus behaviors not included under the policy definition of Sexual Misconduct, the Hearing Panel will use a standard of “More Likely than Not” to determine if a violation occurred.</li>
			</ol>
		<li>The Complainant and Respondent will be notified of the time and place of the Hearing at least seven (7) calendar days prior to the Hearing.</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>The Office of Student Conduct will provide access to the Case File for the Hearing Panel, Complainant, and Respondent at least two (2) calendar days prior to the Hearing.</li>
				<ol type="i">
				<li>Any hard copies of the Case File must be returned to the Hearing Judicial Coordinator for Student Conduct at the conclusion of the Hearing.</li>
				<li>If a digital copy of the Case File is made available to the parties, the parties will lose access to the digital copy at the conclusion of the Hearing.</li>
				<li>Complainants and Respondents are not permitted to share the Case File with any individual(s) other than their advisor and/or parent/guardian(s), provided the parent/guardian(s) is not serving as a witness (see also: Advisor/Support Person, p. 24).</li>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		<li>During the Hearing, the Hearing Panel will conduct separate interviews with the Complainant and Respondent regarding the information in the Case File (see also: Hearing Agenda, p. 30).</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>The Complainant and Respondent may not be present in the Hearing room at the same time. However, each party may listen to and/or watch the other individual’s interview from another room via audio and/or visual technology.</li>
			<li>In the event of technical difficulties, the Office of Student Conduct will make appropriate adjustments to ensure a prompt, thorough, and equitable hearing. These reasonable adjustments may include, but would not be limited to, having the parties in the same room and using a physical barrier to separate and limit interaction between the parties.</li>
			</ol>
		<li>It is expected that the Hearing Panel will rely on the Case File and interviews with the Complainant and Respondent for its determination of the relevant facts of the case. However, at its discretion, the Hearing Panel may request, in advance of the Hearing, additional information or witnesses referenced in the Case File to be presented at the Hearing.</li>
		<li>A finding of responsibility must be determined by a majority vote of the Hearing Panel.</li>
		</ol>

	<li>Sanctioning</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>If the Hearing Panel finds the Respondent “Responsible,” the Hearing Panel will impose sanctions. The Hearing Panel will receive access to each party’s Impact Statement and the information regarding any prior Code of Student Conduct violations by the Respondent, if applicable, to review while deliberating sanctions.</li>
		<li>Due to the serious nature of a sexual misconduct violation, a Hearing Panel will first consider if the Respondent should be removed from the University community to protect the Complainant and/or the common good of University community. There are no minimum sanctions that must be assigned to a Respondent; however, sanctions may likely include Disciplinary Suspension or Dismissal (see also: University Sanctioning Guidelines).</li>
		<li>In considering the appropriate sanction(s), the Hearing Panel may take into account several factors, including but not limited to:</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>Nature of the violation;</li>
			<li>University Sanctioning Guidelines;</li>
			<li>Respondent’s conduct history;</li>
			<li>Impact Statements by the Complainant and Respondent; and/or</li>
			<li>Any other aggravating, mitigating, or relevant factors.</li>
			</ol>
		<li>Any sanction(s) must be decided by a majority vote of the Hearing Panel.</li>
		</ol>

	<li>Notice of Outcome and Letter of Explanation</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>Every reasonable effort will be made for the Hearing Panel to reach its decision within one (1) business day after the Hearing. However, a failure to announce a decision within that time period does not constitute grounds for appeal.</li>
		<li>After the Hearing Panel reaches its decision, the Judicial Hearing Coordinator will compile two documents detailing the outcome of the complaint:</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>Notice of Outcome</li>
			<li>Letter of Explanation</li>
			</ol>
		<li>Notice of Outcome</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>Approximately one (1) business day after the Hearing Panel’s decision, the Hearing Judicial Coordinator and/or Director for Student Conduct will disclose, in writing, the Notice of Outcome to the Respondent and Complainant at approximately the same time.</li>
			<li>The Notice of Outcome for the Respondent may include, but is not limited to:</li>
				<ol type="i">
				<li>The Hearing Panel’s findings for each alleged violation;</li>
				<li>Sanction(s);</li>
				<li>Protective Measures and/or additional remedies that directly relate to the Respondent; and</li>
				<li>Appeal rights.</li>
				</ol>
			<li>The Notice of Outcome for the Complainant may include, but is not limited to:
				<ol type="i">
				<li>The Hearing Panel’s findings for each alleged violation;</li>
				<li>Sanction(s) imposed on the Respondent that directly relate to the Complainant;</li>
				<li>Protective Measures and/or additional remedies offered or provided to the Complainant (see also: Protective Measures and Remedies, p. 23);</li>
				<li>Other steps the University has taken to eliminate any hostile environment, if the University finds one to exist, and prevent the recurrence of misconduct (see also: Protective Measures and Remedies, p. 23); and</li>
				<li>Appeal rights.</li>
				</ol>
			</ol>
		<li>Letter of Explanation</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>Within 10 business days of distributing the Notice of Outcome to both parties, the Hearing Judicial Coordinator for Student Conduct and/or Director for Student</li> Conduct will distribute a Letter of Explanation to the Complainant and Respondent. The Letter of Explanation will offer a more detailed rationale regarding the Hearing Panel’s decision.</li>
			</ol>
		</ol>

	<li>Appealing a Decision</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>Overview</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>The outcome of a formal complaint may be appealed by the Complainant and/or Respondent by submitting a Statement of Appeal to the Office of Student Conduct. A Complainant and/or Respondent who submits a Statement of Appeal is called an “Appellant.”</li>
			<li>An Appellant must submit their Statement of Appeal within seven (7) calendar days of the date on their Letter of Explanation. An Appellant may not submit more than 20 pages of materials in support of their Appeal (see also: Written Statement Guidelines, p. 27).</li>
				<ol type="i">
				<li>A Complainant and/or Respondent may request to review the original Case File while they prepare a Statement of Appeal. The Complainant and/or Respondent must return any hard copies of the Case File to the Office of Student Conduct upon submission of an Appeal. If a digital copy of the Case File is made available to the Complainant and/or Respondent, they will lose access to the digital copy upon submission of an Appeal.</li>
				</ol>
			<li>Complainants and/or Respondents may appeal on the following grounds in cases involving sexual misconduct:</li>
				<ol type="i">
				<li>Substantial Procedural Error: A specified procedural error or error in interpretation of University regulations may have substantially affected the process, such that the Complainant and/or Respondent was denied a fair process.</li>
				<li>New Information of a Substantive Nature: New, significant or relevant information becomes available that could not have been discovered by a properly diligent Investigator at the time of the original decision and that may have substantially affected and/or changed the decision of the Hearing Panel.</li>
				<li>Substantial Disproportionate Sanction: The sanction appears to be substantially disproportionately lenient and/or severe based on the facts of the case, as determined by the Hearing Panel.</li>
				</ol>
			<li>After a Statement of Appeal has been submitted by a Complainant and/or Respondent, the Office of Student Conduct will review the document to ensure that it follows the process’ established policies and procedures. After review, the Office of Student Conduct will allow the Complainant and/or Respondent access to the other party’s Statement of Appeal, in addition to any other information that the Office of Student Conduct deems relevant to the Appeal.</li>
			<li>Each party may submit to the Office of Student Conduct a written response to the other party’s Statement of Appeal within two (2) calendar days of receiving access to the Statement of Appeal. The response must respond to the specific ground(s) for appeal raised in the other party’s Statement of Appeal. The response may not include more than 10 pages of materials. The Director for Student Conduct will allow the other party to review the response (see also: Written Statement Guidelines, p. 27).</li>
				<ol type="i">
				<li>The Complainant and/or Respondent must return any hard copies of the other party’s Statement of Appeal to the Office of Student Conduct upon their deadline to submit a written response. If a digital copy of the other party’s Statement of Appeal is made available to the Complainant and/or Respondent, they will lose access to the digital copy upon their deadline to submit a written response.</li>
				</ol>
			<li>Once all deadlines have passed to submit materials, the Office of Student Conduct will review all materials to ensure that they follow the process’ established policies and procedures. The Office of Student Conduct will compile the Statement of Appeal and any other materials (e.g. the original Case File, the other party’s written response) into the official Appeal Case File. The inclusion of any materials into the Appeal Case File is at the discretion of the Director for Student Conduct.</li>
			<li>The burden of proof rests on the Appellant to establish that the original decision by the Hearing Panel was flawed by a “clear and convincing” standard of proof.</li>
			<li>The Appeals Committee will review the Appeal Case File and make a decision (see also: Appeals Committee, p. 23). Appeals will not consist of any live testimony or interviews.</li>
			</ol>
		<li>Appeals Committee Outcome</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>The following actions may be taken by the Appeals Committee:</li>
				<ol type="i">
				<li>Affirm the finding of “Responsibility” and the original sanctions;</li>
				<li>Affirm the finding of “Responsibility” and alter the original sanctions; or</li>
				<li>Overturn the initial findings and sanctions and return the matter to the Office of Student Conduct for action consistent with the Appeals Committee’s determination.</li>
				</ol>
			<li>Any decision must be determined by a majority vote of the Appeals Committee.</li>
			</ol>
		<li>Notice of Appeal Outcome</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>The Chair of the Appeals Committee will be responsible for compiling the Notice of Appeal Outcome.</li>
			<li>The Chair of the Appeals Committee and/or the Director for Student Conduct will disclose, in writing, the Notice of Appeal Outcome to the Appellant and the other party at approximately the same time.</li>
			<li>Every reasonable effort will be made to issue the Notice of Appeal Outcome within 15 business days of the deadline for submission of the Statement of Appeal.</li>
			<li>The Notice of Appeal Outcome may include, but is not limited to:</li>
				<ol type="i">
				<li>Findings for each ground on which the Appellant appealed;</li>
				<li>Any alterations to sanction(s) that impact the respective party;</li>
				<li>Appeals Committee’s rationale for its decision; and</li>
				<li>Information if the case was referred back to the Office of Student Conduct.</li>
				</ol>
			<li>The Appeals Committee’s decision is final and binding on all parties.</li>

<h2 id="sexualmisconducthearingandappealscommittee">VIII. Sexual Misconduct Hearing and Appeals Committee</h2>
	<ol type="A">
	<li>Pool of Candidates</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>The Office of Student Conduct will maintain a Sexual Misconduct Panel pool of students and faculty/staff members to resolve incidents that include allegations of sexual misconduct. In addition to being trained in the policies and procedures of the Georgetown University student conduct system, these members will receive annual training on, among other things, the University’s policies and procedures, how to conduct a fair and equitable adjudication, and the effects of trauma on parties impacted by sexual misconduct.</li>
		</ol>
	<li>Hearing Panels</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>A Sexual Misconduct Hearing Panel will be assembled from the available pool of candidates and may comprise two (2) faculty/staff members and one (1) student to hear a case involving allegations of sexual misconduct.</li>
			<ol type="a">
			<li>To ensure a student perspective is taken into account during the adjudication of the case, the Office of Student Conduct will typically assign a currently enrolled student to a Hearing Panel. However, in certain circumstances, the Office of Student Conduct may assign a recently graduated student, if they graduated within one semester prior to the Hearing.</li>
			<li>Typically, an undergraduate student will be assigned to the Hearing Panel if the allegations are against an undergraduate student.</li>
			<li>Typically, a graduate student will be assigned to the Hearing Panel if the allegations are against a graduate student.</li>
			</ol>
		<li>At the written request of both the Complainant and Respondent, the Office of Student Conduct will substitute a faculty/staff member in place of the one (1) student member of the panel for Sexual Misconduct cases. If this request is not submitted, in writing, by both the Complainant and Respondent, the Hearing Panel will remain two (2) faculty/staff members and one (1) student.</li>
		<li>The Director for Student Conduct will appoint a Chair of the Hearing Panel. The Chair of the Hearing Panel must be a faculty or staff member. The Chair of the Hearing Panel is charged with the responsibility for ensuring the orderly administration of the Hearing interviews and deliberations.</li>
		<li>The Hearing Judicial Coordinator will attend the Hearing and deliberations. The Hearing Judicial Coordinator will not vote on any decision, but will work with the Chair of the Hearing Panel to ensure that these procedures are conducted in an efficient and orderly fashion. The Hearing Judicial Coordinator may interject in cases of clear procedural error, as well as answer questions of the Hearing Panel regarding procedures.</li>
		<li>The Director for Student Conduct may request University legal counsel to be present at the Hearing and during deliberations. Legal counsel will not vote on any decisions.</li>
		</ol>
	<li>Appeals Committee</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>The Appeals Committee is a standing committee of the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs. The Appeals Committee will consist of:</li>

			<li>Senior Administrator from Student Affairs</li>
			<li>Faculty/staff representative; and</li>
			<li>Student representative.</li>
			</ol>
		<li>Appeals Committee members are not permitted to hear appeals for cases if they served as a voting member on the original Hearing Panel adjudicating the case.</li>
		<li>The Director for Student Conduct may appoint a non-voting Chair of the Appeals Committee, typically the Hearing Judicial Coordinator for Student Conduct, to assure that University procedures are followed throughout the appeal process.</li>
		<li>The Director for Student Conduct may request University legal counsel to be present at Appeals Committee deliberations. Legal counsel will not vote on any decisions.</li>

<h2 id="protectivemeasuresandremedies">IX. Protective Measures and Remedies</h2>
	<ol type="A">
	<li>The University is committed to preventing the recurrence of any sexual misconduct and correcting its discriminatory effects on the Complainant and University community.</li>
	<li>A Hearing Panel, the Title IX Coordinator, Deputy Title IX Coordinator(s), and/or the Director for Student Conduct may determine that Protective Measures and/or additional remedies are necessary and appropriate in order to eliminate a hostile environment, prevent the recurrence of sexual misconduct, and, as appropriate, remedy the effects of sexual misconduct. To ensure equal access to the University’s educational programs and activities for all students, Protective Measures and/or additional remedies may be implemented before, during, and after the processing of a student conduct complaint.</li>
	<li>Since these measures are meant to protect and support all parties involved in the student conduct process and the University community, they may not be considered sanctions and may be implemented regardless of a finding of responsibility.</li>
	<li>The Director for Student Conduct may determine the most appropriate Protective Measures and/or remedies to implement for each specific incident. The Director for Student Conduct may also refer individuals to other offices at the University to discuss Protective Measures and/or remedies outside the purview of the Office of Student Conduct.</li>
	<li>Protective Measures and/or remedies for individual students may include, but are not limited to:</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>No-contact orders;</li>
		<li>Temporary housing and dining changes;</li>
		<li>Employment and/or co-curricular accommodations;</li>

	<li>An advisor may not be a witness, speak, or otherwise participate on behalf of the student. All information concerning all aspects of the case will be communicated by the Office of Student Conduct directly to the student.

</div>

<div id="NonRetaliation">
<h2 id="NonRetaliation">XIII. Non-Retaliation</h2>
	<p>It is illegal and contrary to University policy for any individual to engage, whether directly or indirectly, in retaliatory conduct directed against a person who files a sexual misconduct complaint or gives testimony during an investigation of such a complaint.</p>
	<p>As used in the above paragraph, “retaliatory conduct” means conduct that adversely and unjustifiably affects another’s terms and conditions of employment, educational experience, or quality of life, and that is motivated by an intent to cause harm because of the targeted individual’s involvement in the filing or investigation of a sexual misconduct complaint. Any individual who believes that retaliatory actions have been taken against him or her for having filed a complaint or provided testimony in an investigation of sexual misconduct is encouraged to contact the Director for Student Conduct immediately.</p>

<h2 id="RequestsforAnonymityandorNonPursuitofaComplaint">XV. Requests for Anonymity and/or Non-Pursuit of a Complaint</h2>
	<ol type="A">
	<li>The University will strive to accommodate a Complainant’s wishes to remain anonymous and/or to not pursue a formal complaint for incidents involving allegations of sexual misconduct.</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>When considering whether they wish to remain anonymous and/or to not pursue a formal complaint, Complainants are advised that the University’s ability to respond to the alleged behavior may be limited if the Complainant chooses not to participate in the process. Additionally, Complainants are advised that the University strictly forbids retaliatory conduct against students who choose to file a complaint and/or participate in an investigation of sexual misconduct (see also: Non-Retaliation, p. 25).</li>
		</ol>
	<li>If the Complainant wishes to remain anonymous and/or not pursue a formal complaint, they may submit a written request to the Office of Student Conduct. Consistent with the University’s commitment to provide a reasonably safe and non-discriminatory environment for all students, the Director for Student Conduct may be unable to honor a Complainant’s request and may pursue a case with the University serving as the Complainant. When weighing a Complainant’s request, the Director for Student Conduct may consult with numerous campus partners (e.g. Deputy Title IX Coordinator(s), Threat Assessment, Student Health Services, GUPD, and/or Office of the General Counsel) to consider a range of factors including, but not limited to:</li>
		<ol type="1">
		<li>circumstances that suggest that the Respondent may likely commit additional acts of sexual misconduct;</li>
		<li>circumstances that suggest there is an increased risk of future acts of sexual misconduct under similar circumstances;</li>
		<li>whether the sexual misconduct was perpetrated with a weapon; and</li>
		<li>whether the University possesses other means to obtain relevant evidence.</li>
		</ol>
	<li>In cases where the Director for Student Conduct is able to honor the Complainant’s request and does not pursue a complaint against the Respondent, the Office of Student Conduct may still retain information regarding the incident. This information may be reintroduced into a future complaint against the Respondent.</li>

Specifically, the testimony, whether written or oral, presented by the Respondent, Complainant, or witnesses during the conduct proceedings and all documents provided in preparation for or during the conduct proceeding may not be disclosed to any other party, except for one’s Advisor.</li>
	<li>The Office of Student Conduct will preserve the confidentiality of information provided in connection with a complaint to the extent possible, consistent with the Code of Student Conduct’s Record Retention Policy and the goals of a prompt, thorough, and equitable process.
